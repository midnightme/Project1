# PyMarkets

All my power-markets Python code.

- main python modules: epex, eex, VIK
- analyses for various applications
- cwe.py for retrieving EXAA/NPS-volume data from their websites

Some notes about the data files on the EEX/EPEX-Servers

# Spot Prices

- the csv-files for the day-ahead auction contain the full history

# Derivatives

- The naming of the fields changes throughout the history. This is reflected in the analysis code for EEX-frontyear.
